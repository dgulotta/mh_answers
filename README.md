Answers from the MIT Mystery Hunt

This repository contains a list of answers from the MIT Mystery Hunt
from 1994, 1997, and 1999-present.  These are all the hunts for which
the puzzles bear some resemblance to recent puzzles, and all of the
answers are available.

The files mystery??.txt contain a list of puzzle answers from the
corresponding year, as well as the type of puzzle.  Usually the type
is `Puzzle` or `Meta`, although there are some exceptions as described
below.
Notes on puzzles from individual hunts:
* 2003 - In one round, the puzzle answers were physical objects.  These
answers are not included, but the metapuzzle answer is included.
Answers to training puzzles are classified as "Training".  Both
untrained and trained answers are included and classified as "Puzzle".
* 2005 - In one round, the puzzle answers were physical objects.  These
answers are not included, but the metapuzzle is included.
* 2006 - The ante puzzles are classified as "Ante".
* 2012 - Some cluephrases (which were not puzzle answers) are included;
these are classified as "Clue".

The file `metapuzzles.yml` contains a list of metapuzzles from
2000-present and the answers that feed them.  The `tag` field refers
to the identifier used by /dev/joe's puzzle index.  For example, a
puzzle with the tag `mit20001m` is indexed at the page
http://devjoe.appspot.com/huntindex/puzzle/mit20001m.
As mentioned above, in 2003 and 2005, there were rounds where the
answers were physical object; the corresponding metapuzzles are not
included in `metapuzzles.yml`.

Incomplete lists of answers from 1995-1996 can be found at
http://devjoe.appspot.com/hunt95/ and
http://devjoe.appspot.com/hunt96/, and one answer
from 1998 can be found at http://web.mit.edu/~puzzle/www/1998/.  I do
not know of any source for answers from 1988-1993, and hunts from 1987
and earlier do not bear much resemblance to recent ones.
